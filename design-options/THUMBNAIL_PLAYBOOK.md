# Content Co-op Thumbnail Playbook (v1)

## Goal
Use fewer thumbnails with higher narrative value. Avoid walls of random frames.

## Display Rules
1. `One dominant hero frame` (60-75% visual weight).
2. `Three support thumbnails` only:
   - Context shot (wide scene)
   - Human trust shot (face-first)
   - Process/texture shot (detail or motion)
3. Never auto-rotate hero slides.
4. Add a dark/light scrim where text overlays imagery.
5. Keep thumbnail aspect ratio consistent (16:9 or 4:3), no mixed crops in same row.

## Text Readability Rules
- Use a gradient scrim behind hero copy.
- Target contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for body-size copy.
- Prefer left-to-right scrim if copy is left-aligned.
- Avoid placing copy over high-frequency image zones (faces, dense edges, bright highlights).

## Selection Heuristic (Quick Score)
Score each candidate frame 1-5 on:
- Subject clarity (single focal point)
- Emotional signal (face/gesture/action)
- Negative space for copy
- Brand relevance (field production / operator / outcomes)
- Color separation (foreground vs background)

Use:
- Hero: highest total score + strongest negative space.
- Support set: highest score in each category (context, trust, process).

## Do / Don't
- Do: use caption tags that explain thumbnail role.
- Do: keep motion subtle (hover zoom, horizontal rail drift).
- Don't: stack 10+ equally weighted thumbnails above the fold.
- Don't: use auto-playing carousels that rotate before reading.
