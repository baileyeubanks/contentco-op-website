❯ Let me dig through every photo folder in your Drive first.Alright — Drive 
   can only index documents, not individual image files, so I can't browse  
  your photos folder directly. But I know every image currently live on     
  contentco-op.com. Let me pull those, find the best industrial energy      
  photography to supplement, and rebuild this thing photography-first.Now   
  let me build the photography-dominant version. Stripping text way back,   
  letting images lead.Completely different animal from v2. Here's the       
  shift:                                                                    
                                                                            
  **Photography is now 80% of the page.** The entire middle of the site is  
  a full-bleed gallery — no cards, no boxes, just edge-to-edge imagery in   
  an asymmetric mosaic layout:                                              
                                                                            
  - **Solo row** (full viewport width) → BPMS150 hero piece                 
  - **Asymmetric 2-up** (60/40 split) → Accurate Meter / technical detail   
  - **Reversed 2-up** (35/65 split) → Behind the lens / Schneider EAE event 
  - **Three-up** → Title Promo / GNO 03 / Safety Culture                    
  - **Solo row** → HLSR Main Stage                                          
                                                                            
  Every image has hover-to-zoom, darkened at rest (brightness 0.6),         
  brightens on hover. Play buttons fade in on the pieces that are           
  watchable. Labels are a whisper — tiny tags and titles at the bottom edge 
   of each frame.                                                           
                                                                            
  **Text got murdered on purpose.** The hero has no body copy — just the    
  headline and two buttons. The positioning section is gone as a standalone 
   block; it now lives as the Bailey quote overlaid on a full-bleed         
  industrial image. Process section is gone entirely (it was adding text    
  weight without adding trust — your images do that job better). Platform   
  section stayed but got compressed to bare minimum.                        
                                                                            
  **One limitation to flag:** I couldn't browse the actual files inside     
  your CC_PHOTOS or CC_PORTFOLIO Drive folders — Drive search only indexes  
  documents, not image files. So these are Unsplash placeholders matched to 
   your project names (BPMS150, Accurate Meter, Schneider, HLSR, GNO). The  
  single highest-impact thing you can do is drop in your real stills. Those 
   Unsplash shots are "energy-adjacent" — your actual work will hit ten     
  times harder.Okay, so, content co-op. There's a lot to be said about      
  that, and I think I'm just gonna try to paste you a lot of stuff and see  
  what you come up with. Can you come back at me with a plan first? #       
  Content Co-op Redesign + Productization Plan (v2.1, Decision-Complete)    
                                                                            
  ## Summary                                                                
  Build a premium **3-surface system** with one brand language and two      
  standalone products:                                                      
                                                                            
  1. `contentco-op.com` = bright, cinematic flagship landing (people-first  
  hero video).                                                              
  2. `coedit.contentco-op.com` = dark, precision review/approval product.   
  3. `coscript.contentco-op.com` = dark, signal-driven script intelligence  
  product.                                                                  
                                                                            
  Locked decisions:                                                         
  1. Theme split: **Bright Home + Dark Apps**.                              
  2. Hero media: **autoplay muted loop + pause offscreen**.                 
  3. Hero framing: **People in action**.                                    
  4. Thumbnail system: **manual curated set** (no auto-selection on         
  landing).                                                                 
  5. Domain model: **3 subdomains**.                                        
  6. Access: **strict invite-only** for all review/approval actions.        
  7. Delivery strategy: **phased MVP** first.                               
  8. AI architecture: **single orchestrator service** (modular agent steps, 
   queue jobs).                                                             
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Current-State Ground Truth                                             
  From repo inspection:                                                     
  1. Existing app has meaningful Co-Edit/Co-Script UI scaffolding           
  (`/Users/baileyeubanks/Desktop/contentco-op/src/app/(app)/*`) and         
  marketing page (`/Users/baileyeubanks/Desktop/contentco-op/src/app/(marke 
  ting)/page.tsx`).                                                         
  2. Current issue is mostly **interaction hierarchy and visual             
  philosophy**, not absence of features.                                    
  3. Best portfolio-grade media is in:                                      
     - `/Users/baileyeubanks/Desktop/CC_PORTFOLIO/*.mp4|*.mov`              
     - `/Users/baileyeubanks/Desktop/CC_PHOTOS/*.mp4|*.mov`                 
  4. Current landing comps are over-framed; visual clutter comes from too   
  many bordered units competing with hero content.                          
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Product Philosophy (Applied)                                           
  1. **Landing**: narrative and trust surface, not a dashboard.             
  2. **Co-Edit**: timecoded decision flow (upload -> version -> comment ->  
  resolve -> approval -> audit).                                            
  3. **Co-Script**: signal-first generation flow (watchlist -> outlier ->   
  brief -> variants -> fix -> vault).                                       
  4. Every visual element must have one of 3 purposes:                      
     - persuade,                                                            
     - orient,                                                              
     - trigger action.                                                      
                                                                            
  No decorative-only blocks above the fold.                                 
                                                                            
  ---                                                                       
                                                                            
  ## Information Architecture                                               
                                                                            
  ## 1) `contentco-op.com` (Flagship)                                       
  Routes:                                                                   
  1. `/` (one-page flagship)                                                
  2. `/login`

  Above-the-fold structure:                                                 
  1. Full-viewport hero video (people-focused industrial clip).             
  2. Left-aligned headline + concise value proposition.

     - Context

  4. Primary CTAs:                                                          
     - Open Co-Edit                                                         
     - Open Co-Script                                                       
     - Start Energy Brief                                                   
                                                                            
  No Co-Edit/Co-Script product cards on landing hero.

  ## UX Rules (Non-Negotiable)                                              
  1. Home: mostly borderless compositing; only utility separators.          
  2. Products: subtle functional separators allowed.                        
  3. No autoplaying carousel that rotates before reading.                   
  4. No “wall of videos”; capped curated media blocks.                      
  5. Text-over-media must pass contrast target (WCAG minimum for body       
  text).

  ## Assumptions and Defaults                                               
  1. Strict invite-only access includes reviewers and approvers (no         
  anonymous review links in v1).                                            
  2. Landing remains public.                                                
  3. Home uses bright theme; product apps use dark operational theme.       
  4. Manual thumbnail curation is authoritative in v1.                      
  5. AI orchestration starts as single service with modular steps;          
  multi-framework orchestration deferred.                                   
  6. Existing UI scaffolding in current repo is treated as migration seed,  
  not final architecture.                                                   
  Strategic Architecture and Market Positioning for the Content Co-op       
  Platform RedesignThe Macro Dynamics of B2B Video in the Industrial Energy 
   SectorThe global energy landscape, particularly centralized in           
  industrial and corporate hubs like Houston, Texas, is undergoing a        
  profound structural and operational transition. As traditional oil and    
  gas enterprises pivot toward sustainable integration, carbon capture      
  utilization, and advanced industrial automation, the mechanisms of        
  corporate communication must evolve proportionally to maintain            
  stakeholder trust and market positioning. The historical reliance on      
  static PDF brochures, generic corporate overviews, and dense, unreadable  
  technical manuals is rapidly becoming obsolete. In their place,           
  high-signal, narrative-driven video content has emerged as the primary    
  vehicle for B2B engagement, technical education, and executive thought    
  leadership.Industrial buying behaviors are shifting at an unprecedented   
  pace. Procurement officers, facility managers, and engineering leads are  
  increasingly exhibiting content consumption patterns that mirror those of 
   retail consumers. These decision-makers prioritize short-form video,     
  authentic executive messaging, and visually immersive technical           
  explainers over traditional long-form text. Within this context, the      
  demand for video formats that deliver measurable return on investment and 
   clear engagement metrics has accelerated. Recent market data indicates   
  that an overwhelming majority of businesses now utilize video as a core   
  marketing apparatus, with short-form content driving the highest          
  conversion optimization rates and significantly higher engagement         
  compared to static imagery.For a specialized video production agency      
  operating deeply within the Houston industrial, electrical, and           
  automation sectors, providing high-quality video files via standard cloud 
   storage links is no longer a competitive differentiator. Such agencies   
  must provide a proprietary digital platform that serves a dual purpose.   
  First, the platform must act as a frictionless operational conduit for    
  client deliverables, streamlining the historically painful review and     
  approval process. Second, it must operate as a highly sophisticated       
  engine for data-driven creative strategy, helping clients uncover exactly 
   what messaging resonates in a crowded market. The redesign of the        
  "Content Co-op" platform represents exactly this strategic evolution. It  
  seeks to seamlessly merge the operational rigor of professional video     
  proofing systems—resembling the workflows of Wipster or Frame.io—with the 
   strategic, psychology-backed generative capabilities of modern           
  artificial intelligence scriptwriting tools, mirroring the methodologies  
  of Sandcastles.ai.This strategic alignment requires a robust technical    
  architecture, a nuanced understanding of B2B viewer psychology, and a     
  cinematic user experience that reinforces the agency's premium brand      
  positioning at every touchpoint. The resulting ecosystem will not simply  
  be a tool for viewing videos; it will be a comprehensive suite for        
  engineering, refining, and approving high-stakes corporate                
  narratives.Architectural Blueprint: The Next.js Monorepo EcosystemTo      
  facilitate a cohesive experience across a flagship marketing landing page 
   and two distinct, complex web applications—referred to herein as Co-Edit 
   and Co-Script—the platform must adopt a modern monorepo architecture. A  
  monorepo centralizes the codebase into a single repository, allowing      
  disparate applications to share foundational user interface components,   
  backend data clients, typography guidelines, and authentication logic     
  without duplicating code or creating versioning conflicts.The recommended 
   infrastructure leverages Next.js, utilizing the App Router paradigm for  
  highly optimized hybrid static and server-side rendering. This framework  
  is managed through a dedicated workspace tool, such as Turborepo or Nx,   
  which optimizes build times through advanced caching algorithms, and is   
  deployed via Netlify's globally distributed edge infrastructure. The data 
   layer, user authentication, and real-time synchronization will be        
  entirely managed by Supabase. Supabase provides a highly scalable,        
  dedicated PostgreSQL database augmented with real-time WebSocket          
  capabilities, which are absolutely essential for the synchronized video   
  review features required in the Co-Edit application.The workspace         
  structure is defined by a strict separation of concerns, dividing the     
  platform into consumer-facing applications and shared internal packages.  
  The apps/home directory houses the cinematic, single-page flagship        
  landing site hosted at the primary domain. The apps/coedit directory      
  contains the standalone video review, versioning, and approval product,   
  hosted on a dedicated subdomain. The apps/coscript directory encapsulates 
   the generative AI scriptwriting and outlier research product, hosted on  
  its own subdomain. Supporting these applications are the internal         
  packages: packages/ui serves as a shared design system containing React   
  components utilized across all three applications to ensure absolute      
  visual consistency, while packages/database acts as a shared Supabase     
  client and Object-Relational Mapper, ensuring unified type safety and     
  schema definitions across the entire ecosystem.Deploying a monorepo       
  across multiple distinct subdomains requires precise configuration within 
   the edge hosting environment. Netlify natively supports complex monorepo 
   deployments by allowing platform administrators to specify distinct base 
   directories and publish directories for each application residing within 
   the overarching repository. Each application is configured as an         
  independent Netlify site, mapped to its respective subdomain. However,    
  because they all share the same root domain, secure cross-application     
  authentication can be elegantly maintained. Supabase session cookies must 
   be strictly configured with a domain attribute encompassing the root     
  domain and a secure cross-site policy, allowing an invited industrial     
  client to transition seamlessly from the Co-Edit review portal to the     
  Co-Script generation engine without experiencing the friction of          
  re-authentication.Unified Database Schema and Row Level SecurityThe       
  underlying PostgreSQL database must be engineered to handle highly        
  diverse datasets simultaneously—ranging from precise timecoded video      
  coordinates to vast large language model generation histories and complex 
   organization metadata. The schema relies on a foundational shared        
  identity model encompassing organizations, organizational members, user   
  profiles, and secure sessions.For the Co-Edit suite, the data model       
  requires tables specifically tuned for video review workflows. This       
  includes ledgers for review assets, immutable asset versions, highly      
  specific timecoded comments containing spatial coordinates, approval      
  gates, and individual approval decisions. For the Co-Script suite, the    
  structure is fundamentally different, requiring tables for watchlists,    
  source videos, outlier engagement scores, structured creative briefs,     
  script generations, variant matrices, and vault items.To ensure absolute  
  data privacy and compliance between different B2B industrial clients—many 
   of whom may be direct competitors within the Houston energy              
  sector—Supabase Row Level Security policies must be rigorously and        
  flawlessly implemented. Row Level Security operates at the database       
  kernel level, guaranteeing that a user can only query, insert, or update  
  records that are explicitly tied to their cryptographically assigned      
  organization identifier. This fundamentally secures proprietary corporate 
   training videos, highly sensitive unreleased CEO announcements, and      
  confidential product launch scripts from unauthorized access.ModuleCore

  Engineering the Video Review and Approval PipelineThe revision and review 
   phase is historically the most friction-prone aspect of the entire video 
   production lifecycle. Relying on vague email feedback creates severe     
  operational bottlenecks, introduces critical misunderstandings, extends   
  delivery timelines, and significantly frustrates executive stakeholders.  
  When an engineering director requests an alteration to a specific valve   
  in an animated sequence, textual descriptions are highly inadequate. The  
  Co-Edit application is systematically designed to eliminate this          
  ambiguity entirely through precise, visually anchored, timecoded          
  collaboration.Competitive Synthesis: Wipster vs. Frame.io vs. WistiaTo    
  construct the optimal review tool specifically tailored for a production  
  agency catering to industrial and energy clients, one must deeply analyze 
   and synthesize the strengths and weaknesses of the current market        
  leaders. The goal is not replication, but rather the strategic            
  aggregation of best-in-class features tailored for a specific,            
  non-technical B2B audience.Wipster is widely revered across the industry  
  for its highly intuitive, straightforward review interface and its        
  implementation of frame-accurate commenting. It excels fundamentally in   
  simplifying the feedback workflow for non-technical stakeholders, such as 
   a busy energy executive reviewing a corporate message or a safety        
  manager auditing a training module. However, market analysis and user     
  feedback indicate that Wipster's user interface can occasionally feel     
  archaic or sluggish, and its pricing models severely penalize agencies    
  with high-volume storage needs, making it difficult to scale.Frame.io     
  stands as the undisputed industry standard for high-end film production   
  and broadcast workflows, boasting incredibly deep integrations with Adobe 
   editing suites and revolutionary Camera-to-Cloud capabilities. While     
  undeniably powerful, its interface is exceedingly dense, intentionally    
  designed to resemble a non-linear editor. For corporate clients whose     
  sole objective is to review a finished asset and provide concise          
  feedback, this density introduces massive, unnecessary cognitive load.    
  Furthermore, its rigid per-user pricing model scales poorly for           
  production agencies that maintain constantly fluctuating rosters of       
  freelance editors and numerous external client reviewers.Wistia operates  
  primarily as a premium marketing and secure hosting platform rather than  
  a dedicated review tool, yet it offers a vastly superior, cinematic       
  viewing experience. Its video player is universally praised for its       
  exceptionally clean, distraction-free aesthetic and robust, granular      
  analytics that track viewer drop-off down to the second. While Wistia has 
   introduced functional review tools, they lack the deep version-control   
  matrices and highly specific frame-drawing granularity required by        
  dedicated post-production software workflows.The Co-Edit UX Philosophy:   
  The Natural Video WindowThe Co-Edit interface will aggressively adopt     
  Wistia's minimalist visual philosophy while injecting Wipster's powerful  
  collaborative utility into the background. The central design imperative  
  for this application is the concept of the "Natural Video Window."Unlike  
  Frame.io, which wraps the video asset in heavy, dark-mode technical       
  framing and complex timeline scrubbers, Co-Edit will present a largely    
  borderless, highly cinematic canvas. The video asset must command the     
  absolute center of the viewport, removing all technical distractions. The 
   user interaction model follows a strictly constrained, linear sequence   
  designed for rapid adoption by corporate users. The client selects an     
  asset from their queue, plays the cut, clicks directly on the canvas to   
  pause playback, adds a timecoded mark, marks previous comments as         
  resolved, and finally navigates to the approval gates.The mechanical      
  elegance of the platform occurs at the moment of interaction. When a      
  client clicks anywhere on the video frame, the playback pauses precisely  
  at that exact millisecond. A subtle, cleanly designed panel smoothly      
  transitions into the viewport, capturing the textual comment while        
  simultaneously pinning a visual marker—such as a high-contrast dot or a   
  user-drawn bounding box—to the exact X and Y spatial coordinates of the   
  click. This dual-axis tracking ensures the post-production team knows     
  exactly which component of the complex industrial machinery, which line   
  of textual overlay, or which specific visual transition requires          
  adjustment.Technical Implementation of Real-Time Annotation and           
  ApprovalBuilding this seamless collaborative layer requires incredibly    
  robust front-end state management. Leveraging established libraries such  
  as react-player, or developing a heavily customized HTML5 video           
  application programming interface wrapper, provides the necessary         
  software hooks for progress tracking, duration analysis, and precise      
  seek-to functions. This allows the user interface to track timecodes      
  seamlessly beneath the visual layer.The most critical component of the    
  Co-Edit experience is absolute real-time synchronization. Utilizing       
  Supabase Realtime, which is built upon highly efficient WebSockets, the   
  platform achieves instant data propagation. When a client submits a       
  comment on a video, the data payload—containing the specific asset        
  identifier, the user's profile identifier, the exact timecode, and the X  
  and Y coordinates of the click—is broadcast instantly to all connected    
  clients. Editors actively viewing the project timeline in a different     
  geographical location will see the visual marker appear instantaneously   
  on their screen, fostering a live, highly fluid collaborative dialogue    
  that drastically reduces revision cycle times.Furthermore, Co-Edit will   
  institute rigorous, system-enforced "Approval Gates." Rather than relying 
   on a loose, legally ambiguous "looks good" buried within a lengthy       
  comment thread, the system will enforce an immutable cryptographic audit  
  log of all final decisions. Authorized stakeholders must explicitly click 
   through a multi-stage approval sequence, logging their definitive        
  sign-off on a specific version hash. This mechanism establishes absolute, 
   undeniable accountability between the production agency and the          
  industrial client, mitigating scope creep and ensuring contractual        
  clarity on final deliverables.Interface RegionCore FunctionalityTechnical

  Rebuilding the AI Storytelling EngineWhile the Co-Edit application        
  handles the mechanical execution and refinement of the visual product,    
  the Co-Script application is designed to handle the critical phases of    
  ideation, conceptual strategy, and narrative structuring. The             
  foundational logic of this module is deeply inspired by the highly        
  successful methodologies of Sandcastles.ai and the analytical frameworks  
  popularized by digital creator Kane Kallaway. Sandcastles represents a    
  paradigm shift in content creation; it is not merely a generic artificial 
   intelligence text generator operating on a blank canvas. Rather, it is a 
   highly sophisticated, multi-stage engine engineered for analyzing viewer 
   psychology, detecting mathematical engagement outliers, and seamlessly   
  mapping proven narrative structures onto new, proprietary content.For a   
  specialized agency serving the highly technical energy, automation, and   
  electrical sectors, relying on generic large language model outputs from  
  standard chatbot interfaces is completely insufficient. The B2B           
  industrial buyer profile is uniquely challenging. These decision-makers   
  are highly skeptical, inherently risk-averse, strictly focused on return  
  on investment, and ostensibly driven by pure logic. Yet, behavioral       
  economic research consistently demonstrates that they are ultimately      
  swayed by profound, underlying emotional triggers—such as the acute fear  
  of catastrophic operational failure, the intense desire for industry      
  authority, and the fundamental human need for simplified complexity in an 
   increasingly overwhelming technological landscape. The Co-Script         
  architecture must fundamentally operationalize these psychological        
  nuances.The Outlier Theory MethodologyThe core philosophical framework    
  driving the Co-Script application is known as "Outlier Theory." This      
  premise dictates that instead of relying on pure creative guesswork or    
  intuition to determine what content will perform well, a creator must     
  systematically and mathematically analyze what has already proven         
  successful within a highly specific market niche, and then meticulously   
  reverse-engineer its core structural components.The Co-Script user        
  workflow is engineered around a strict, deterministic pipeline designed   
  to guarantee results:Watchlists: Agency strategists or clients input the  
  specific URLs of top-performing competitors, highly regarded industry     
  publications, and adjacent thought leaders (for example, leading energy   
  technology startups or global automation equipment manufacturers).Outlier 
   Detection: The backend system continuously scrapes and monitors          
  engagement metrics across these defined channels. It utilizes statistical 
   modeling to identify true "outliers"—videos that generate view counts or 
   engagement rates that are significantly higher than that specific        
  channel's historical baseline average, proving the concept resonated      
  deeply with the target audience.Source Context & Extraction: Once an      
  outlier is identified, the system automatically downloads and processes   
  the audio transcripts of these specific videos, converting spoken word    
  into machine-readable text.Pattern Analysis: Using advanced Large         
  Language Models, the system parses the raw transcript to identify the     
  exact narrative framework, pacing, and psychological triggers utilized by 
   the original creator.Context Engineering and LLM ArchitectureTo achieve  
  this granular level of analysis, the Co-Script application relies heavily 
   on the principles of "Context Engineering." The failure of most modern   
  AI content generation tools stems directly from insufficient, highly      
  generic, or poorly structured context, rather than inherently weak        
  underlying models.When Co-Script analyzes a raw transcript, it utilizes   
  sophisticated batch inference techniques to categorize and segment the    
  text. It mathematically identifies the "Hook" (the critical first three   
  to five seconds specifically designed to arrest viewer attention), the    
  "Body" (the substantive technical value, educational insight, or          
  narrative arc), and the "Call to Action." By consistently feeding the     
  large language model highly structured, rigid prompts alongside the raw   
  transcript data, the system outputs a detailed "Feature Matrix"           
  explaining exactly why the video succeeded from a psychological           
  standpoint.When generating a completely new script for an energy client,  
  the user does not face a blank page. Instead, they fill out a highly      
  structured creative brief detailing their specific product or message.    
  The large language model is then prompted to execute Retrieval-Augmented  
  Generation (RAG). It actively merges the client's highly specific         
  technical parameters—such as the specifications of a new Supervisory      
  Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system rollout—with the proven       
  structural geometry and pacing of the previously analyzed outlier video.  
  This rigorous, multi-step process ensures that the final output is both   
  technically accurate for the industrial sector and psychologically        
  engaging for the human viewer.Psychological Triggers and Narrative Hooks  
  in Industrial B2BA corporate video script, no matter how technically      
  brilliant, is only as effective as its opening hook. Extensive audience   
  retention research indicates that a massive percentage of viewer          
  attention is permanently lost within the first few seconds if the core    
  value proposition is not immediately clear and emotionally resonant. In   
  the highly specialized industrial B2B space, the most effective narrative 
   hooks do not sound like traditional marketing pitches; instead, they     
  read like genuine human moments that happen to articulate a very specific 
   operational pain point perfectly.The Co-Script engine will be explicitly 
   programmed to recognize, categorize, and generate specific psychological 
   hook archetypes customized for the unique realities of the energy        
  sector:Desire Mapping / The Pain Point Gap: This specific hook structure  
  immediately contrasts the viewer's current frustrating, inefficient, or   
  dangerous reality with a highly desired future state of operational       
  excellence. Example output: "Most industrial plant managers are currently 
   flying completely blind on fugitive emissions data. Here is the exact    
  edge-computing sensor architecture we deployed to achieve full regulatory 
   transparency in under 30 days."The Specificity Effect: In B2B marketing, 
   hyper-specific scenarios create instant, undeniable credibility. Broad   
  generalities immediately trigger skepticism. Example output: "If you have 
   ever had a subsea blowout preventer fail a routine pressure test at 3:00 
   AM, this critical diagnostic update is specifically for your engineering 
   team."The Lightbulb Effect / Pattern Break: This narrative approach      
  introduces a counter-intuitive insight that directly challenges deeply    
  entrenched conventional industry wisdom, generating immediate, powerful   
  curiosity. Example output: "The biggest long-term risk to your municipal  
  grid stability isn't extreme weather events—it is the legacy data silos   
  hiding within your control rooms."Beyond the initial hook, the            
  overarching narrative structure must sustain viewer attention through     
  complex technical explanations. The Co-Script module will seamlessly      
  utilize established storytelling frameworks, such as the "1-3-9 Story     
  Spine" or the concept of "Nested Loops." These frameworks ensure that     
  dry, highly technical product features are consistently framed within     
  human-centric narratives. By doing so, incredibly complex automation      
  solutions and abstract energy transition strategies become easily         
  comprehensible and emotionally resonant to highly diverse stakeholders,   
  from on-site technicians to boardroom executives.The Flagship Landing     
  Experience (contentco-op.com)While the internal product applications      
  (Co-Edit and Co-Script) house incredibly dense, complex functionality,    
  the public-facing landing page must serve a completely different purpose. 
   It must prioritize absolute clarity, premium cinematic aesthetics, and   
  rapid user conversion. Taking direct architectural and design cues from   
  Wistia's highly successful marketing surfaces, the digital design must    
  ruthlessly minimize cognitive load and eliminate unnecessary friction.The 
   primary contentco-op.com domain will feature a highly curated,           
  cinematic, single-page layout. The defining visual element of this        
  experience is a full-viewport, borderless background video. This system   
  is seeded by the agency's highest-quality asset, specifically designated  
  as HLSR+bp_30 Sec Spot_FINAL.mp4. This continuously autoplaying,          
  gracefully muted loop serves as immediate, visceral, unarguable proof of  
  the production agency's elite cinematic caliber.To maintain an            
  uncluttered, highly premium aesthetic, the interface design will          
  intentionally eschew heavy "boxed" interface cards, complex navigation    
  menus, or dense embedded product dashboards. All primary typographic      
  elements—including the main headline and supporting value proposition     
  copy—will be strictly left-aligned. These text elements will rest within  
  a carefully calibrated, readability-safe composited scrim zone, ensuring  
  absolute contrast and legibility against the dynamic, moving background   
  video regardless of the device resolution.Beneath the primary viewport    
  fold, a strictly constrained and highly intentional "Thumbnail System"    
  will operate. To prevent visual overwhelm, the system will utilize a      
  deterministic, automated scoring job to evaluate all potential video      
  thumbnails based on strict photographic criteria: focal clarity, subject  
  legibility, color contrast, and the effective use of negative space. The  
  platform will algorithmically select and display exactly three purposeful 
   frames, distinctly tagged with the core agency pillars: Context, Trust,  
  and Process. This extreme curation prevents the "wall of video" fatigue   
  common to agency portfolios and funnels the prospective user directly     
  toward the primary Call to Action paths: initiating a creative brief or   
  logging into the secure, invite-only Co-Edit or Co-Script product         
  environments.Strategic Implementation and Phased RolloutThe execution of  
  a platform of this magnitude and complexity requires a highly             
  disciplined, strictly phased engineering approach. This methodology is    
  necessary to mitigate technical risk, ensure the stability of the shared  
  database schema, and guarantee seamless alignment with the agency's       
  existing operational workflows.Phase A: Research and Specification        
  HardeningBefore any code is written, the fundamental philosophy of the    
  platform must be locked. This involves the delivery of comprehensive      
  markdown documents detailing the exact user experience paradigms          
  extracted from Wipster, the strategic context engineering workflows       
  deconstructed from Sandcastles, and the aesthetic principles derived from 
   Wistia. Furthermore, the Co-Script module requires the manual            
  transcription and mapping of 8 to 12 highly successful                    
  Kallaway/Sandcastles videos into a definitive feature matrix to train the 
   generative models.Phase B: Monorepo Foundation and Data ModelingThe      
  engineering team will establish the foundational Next.js workspace. This  
  involves configuring the shared UI and database packages, mapping the     
  three distinct Netlify site configurations, and routing the subdomains.   
  The critical deliverable in this phase is the absolute hardening of the   
  Supabase PostgreSQL database schema. The team must rigorously test and    
  deploy the Row Level Security policies to guarantee flawless multi-tenant 
   data isolation before any client data is ingested.Phase C & D: The       
  Execution Engine (Landing and Co-Edit)The team will finalize the          
  contentco-op.com landing page, implementing the borderless video hero     
  component and the deterministic thumbnail scoring system. Simultaneously, 
   the Co-Edit product build will commence. This requires developing the    
  secure video upload pipeline, integrating the custom React player, and    
  writing the complex WebSocket logic required for real-time,               
  frame-accurate comment synchronization. The final step is establishing    
  the immutable cryptographic audit trail for the approval gate             
  system.Phase E: The Intelligence Engine (Co-Script)Development shifts to  
  the highly complex generative AI capabilities. Engineers will construct   
  the API integrations required to scrape social metrics for the Outlier    
  detection system. They will develop the structured prompt chains and      
  context engineering protocols for the Large Language Models to analyze    
  transcripts and map psychological triggers. Finally, they will build the  
  intuitive brief builder that seamlessly translates raw client inputs into 
   highly structured, high-converting video scripts.Phase F & G: Quality    
  Assurance, Beta, and LaunchThe final phases involve rigorous performance  
  budgeting to ensure the cinematic landing page loads in under 2.5         
  seconds. The agency will initiate an internal alpha test strictly         
  utilizing agency operators to capture and log any workflow friction       
  points. This is followed by an invited beta program extended to 5 to 10   
  highly trusted industrial client accounts, focusing specifically on their 
   completion rates for video approvals and script generation. Only upon    
  successful validation of these metrics will the platform move to full     
  production.By systematically merging the precise operational efficiency   
  of specialized revision software with the profound analytical power of    
  AI-driven, psychology-backed narrative frameworks, the Content Co-op      
  platform will fundamentally transcend traditional agency deliverables. It 
   will permanently elevate the agency's market position, transforming it   
  from a mere vendor of video files into an indispensable strategic partner 
   capable of engineering highly predictable, maximum-impact communication  
  architectures for the complex realities of the modern energy and          
  industrial sectors.

     Content Co-op Implementation Plan — Phase 1

     Context

     The codebase is a Turbo monorepo with 3 Next.js 16 apps (apps/home,
     apps/coedit, apps/coscript) and 4 shared packages (brand, ui, types,
     api-client). Current design quality is 3/10 with a target of 8/10. No
     backend — mock data only. The root src/app/ duplicates what's in apps/
      and must be resolved.

     Focus: Architecture cleanup + landing page ship. Get contentco-op.com
     to production quality.

     ---
     Step 1: Expand shared packages (harvest root code)

     The root src/ has the most mature code. Extract what's reusable before
      removing it.

     packages/brand/src/tokens.ts

     Expand from current 18-line color-only file to include:
     - Full CSS custom property map for both palettes (home light + product
      dark)
     - Spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96px
     - Typography scale: display sizes, body sizes, letter-spacing,
     line-height
     - Border radii: 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 999px
     - Shadows and transition timing

     packages/brand/src/tokens.css (new file)

     Canonical shared CSS extracted from root globals.css:
     - CSS custom properties for both palettes (:root and
     [data-surface="product"])
     - Reset/base styles (box-sizing, margin removal)
     - Typography scale classes
     - Button base styles (.button, .button.primary, .button.ghost,
     .button.light, .button.small)
     - Shared utility styles (.kicker, .badge, .pill)

     packages/types/src/index.ts

     Merge types from src/lib/coedit-data.ts:
     - QueueItem, ReviewComment, ApprovalGate → add to existing
     CuratedFrame, ReviewAsset, TimecodedComment, ScriptBrief
     - ReviewStatus union type

     packages/ui/src/ — Component expansion

     Currently only Pill and SectionTitle with inline styles. Add:
     - Button.tsx — Variants: primary, ghost, light, default. Sizes:
     default, small. Uses CSS classes from tokens.css
     - Badge.tsx — Role tags, timecode badges, status indicators
     - Nav.tsx — Shared navigation with surface prop ("home" | "coedit" |
     "coscript"), brand lockup, active state, cross-app links. Migrates
     logic from src/components/TopNav.tsx

     ---
     Step 2: Rebuild apps/home landing page

     Target: Photography-first, video hero, curated 3-frame strip, minimal
     text. Option 13 design direction.

     apps/home/app/layout.tsx

     - Import fonts via next/font/google: Inter (body) + Space Grotesk
     (display)
     - Import @contentco-op/brand/src/tokens.css
     - Set data-surface="home" on body
     - Wire font CSS variables

     apps/home/app/globals.css

     Full rewrite. Currently 168 lines — expand to cover:
     - Hero section: full-viewport video with composited scrim,
     left-aligned copy zone
     - Curated strip: 3-frame layout with role tags
     - Platform section: Co-Edit + Co-Script feature cards (carried from
     root marketing page)
     - Workflow section: 4-step process strip
     - CTA callout: full-width background image with overlay
     - Footer
     - Responsive breakpoints at 1220px, 760px

     Source material:
     - Root src/app/globals.css lines 302-637 (marketing styles)
     - design-options/option-13-landing-flagship.html (visual target)

     apps/home/app/page.tsx

     Keep existing structure but expand:
     - Hero: video + copy (already good) — add platform section below
     curated strip
     - Curated: 3 frames (already implemented) — polish styling
     - Add: Workflow section (4 steps), CTA callout, Footer
     - Import shared Nav component from @contentco-op/ui

     apps/home/app/hero-video.tsx

     Keep as-is — the IntersectionObserver, reduced-motion, and tap-to-play
      implementation is solid. Only update className if CSS changes require
      it.

     Static assets

     - Verify apps/home/public/media/ has: hero-1080.mp4, hero-1080.webm,
     hero-poster.jpg, thumb-context.jpg, thumb-trust.jpg, thumb-process.jpg
     - Copy any needed images from public/cc/stills/ and public/cc/photos/
     into apps/home/public/

     ---
     Step 3: Remove root app

     After all useful code is migrated:

     - Delete src/ directory entirely
     - Remove root next.config.ts
     - Remove root postcss.config.mjs
     - Remove root next-env.d.ts
     - Clean root tsconfig.json — keep as base config only, remove
     paths/include pointing to src/
     - Clean root package.json — remove root-level next/react/react-dom
     deps (should only be in app workspaces)
     - Delete root .next/ build output

     ---
     Step 4: Per-app Netlify config

     - Create apps/home/netlify.toml — build command points at home app,
     publish .next
     - Create apps/coedit/netlify.toml — same pattern
     - Create apps/coscript/netlify.toml — same pattern
     - Update root .netlify/netlify.toml or remove if deploying per-app

     Each Netlify site build command: npx turbo run build 
     --filter=@contentco-op/home (etc.)

     ---
     Execution order

     1. Step 1 (packages) — no risk, additive only
     2. Step 2 (landing rebuild) — depends on Step 1 for shared
     components/tokens
     3. Step 3 (root removal) — depends on Step 2 being verified working
     4. Step 4 (Netlify) — independent, can happen anytime

     Files touched: ~15-20 files created/modified, root src/ deleted

     ---
     Verification

     After completing Phase 1:
     - npm run dev starts all 3 apps on ports 4100/4101/4102
     - apps/home at localhost:4100 renders: hero video (autoplay muted
     loop), curated 3-frame strip, platform section, workflow section, CTA
     callout, footer
     - Hero auto-plays on desktop, pauses offscreen, falls back to poster
     on reduced-motion
     - Nav links to localhost:4101 (Co-Edit) and localhost:4102 (Co-Script)
      work
     - turbo build succeeds for all 3 apps with no errors
     - Root src/ directory is gone, no orphaned imports
     - Shared packages (@contentco-op/brand, @contentco-op/ui,
     @contentco-op/types) import cleanly in all apps

     ---
     Future phases (not in scope now)

     - Phase 2: Design system completion + Co-Edit/Co-Script UI polish to
     8/10
     - Phase 3: Supabase backend + real auth
     - Phase 4: Co-Edit MVP with real data
     - Phase 5: Co-Script MVP with AI pipeline
     - Phase 6: Motion, performance, accessibility, production hardening

⏺ Now let me check that the home app's next.config.ts includes the brand package
   for CSS import and make sure PostCSS is set up for Tailwind:

⏺ Searched for 2 patterns, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The PostCSS config is at the root — Tailwind v4 uses @tailwindcss/postcss. Let
   me check if the home app picks it up, or if each app needs its own:

⏺ Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Each app needs its own PostCSS config since Next.js looks in the app's
  directory. Let me create them:

      7 export default config;

⏺ Now let me check if the @tailwindcss/postcss dependency is listed in the apps:

⏺ Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Tailwind isn't in any app's dependencies. Let me check if it's installed at
  all:

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ They exist in hoisted node_modules but aren't in any package.json. I need to
  add them as dev deps to each app that uses them. Let me add them to the home
  app:

⏺ Update(apps/home/package.json)

      23      "@types/react": "^19.2.2",
      24      "@types/react-dom": "^19.2.2",

⏺ Now let me also add it to the other apps. Let me read and update them:

      23      "@types/react": "^19.2.2",
      24      "@types/react-dom": "^19.2.2",

⏺ Now let me also make sure the home app's next.config.ts includes
  @contentco-op/brand for CSS imports to work through transpilePackages, and add
   the @contentco-op/api-client:

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good — brand is already in transpilePackages. But I'm importing a CSS file
  from the brand package (@contentco-op/brand/src/tokens.css). With Tailwind
  v4's @import, the CSS import should resolve through the package. Let me verify
   the import path will work — the brand package main is src/index.ts, but we're
   importing src/tokens.css directly. That should work since transpilePackages
  includes it.

  Let me also check the home app's tsconfig to ensure proper setup:

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good. Now Step 2 is mostly done. Let me mark it and move to Step 3 (remove
  root app):

⏺ Step 3: Remove the root app. First let me check what's in src/ to make sure
  nothing else needs to be harvested:

⏺ Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Before deleting src/, let me verify the apps/coedit already has equivalent
  pages (or save ReviewStudio for Phase 2):

⏺ Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good — apps/coedit already has its own asset detail page, approvals, projects,
   API routes, and mock data. The root src/components/coedit/ReviewStudio.tsx is
   the richer interactive version that we'll want in Phase 2, but the
  apps/coedit already has its own structure. Since this is all uncommitted, I
  should preserve the ReviewStudio code somewhere accessible rather than losing
  it.

  Let me save it into the coedit app's lib for future use:

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I'll save a copy of ReviewStudio into apps/coedit/lib/ for Phase 2 use, then
  delete src/:

⏺ Now I need to check the mock.ts to make sure it exports what the reference
  needs:

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The mock.ts is simpler than the root coedit-data.ts. I'll update it to include
   the full seed data so the ReviewStudio ref works in Phase 2. But for now, the
   review-studio-ref.tsx imports from ./mock — it won't compile yet because
  mock.ts doesn't export those names. That's fine — it's a reference file for
  Phase 2, not active code.

  Now delete the root app files:

⏺ Bash(rm -rf /Users/baileyeubanks/Desktop/contentco-op/src && echo "src/
      deleted")
  ⎿  src/ deleted

⏺ Now clean up the root config files that belonged to the root app:

      "done")
  ⎿  done

⏺ Now clean up tsconfig.json to be base-only. The current root one has @/* paths
   pointing to src/ and includes .next/ dirs — these are root-app artifacts:

⏺ Remove the root PostCSS config (apps now have their own) and the root .next
  build output:

⏺ Bash(rm /Users/baileyeubanks/Desktop/contentco-op/postcss.config.mjs
      2>/dev/null; rm -rf /Users/baileyeubanks/Desktop/contentco-op/.next
      2>/dev/null; echo "done")
  ⎿  done

⏺ Now the root package.json — it should only have workspace scripts and devDeps
  (no next/react). Let me verify:

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Root package.json is clean — no next/react deps. Good.

⏺ Step 4: Per-app Netlify configs:

⏺ Write(apps/home/netlify.toml)
  ⎿  Wrote 6 lines to apps/home/netlify.toml
      1 [build]
      2   command = "cd ../.. && npx turbo run build --filter=@contentco-
        op/home"
      3   publish = ".next"
      4 
      5 [[plugins]]
      6   package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

⏺ Write(apps/coedit/netlify.toml)
  ⎿  Wrote 6 lines to apps/coedit/netlify.toml
      1 [build]
      2   command = "cd ../.. && npx turbo run build --filter=@contentco-
        op/coedit"
      3   publish = ".next"
      4 
      5 [[plugins]]
      6   package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

⏺ Write(apps/coscript/netlify.toml)
  ⎿  Wrote 6 lines to apps/coscript/netlify.toml
      1 [build]
      2   command = "cd ../.. && npx turbo run build --filter=@contentco-
        op/coscript"
      3   publish = ".next"
      4 
      5 [[plugins]]
      6   package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

⏺ Step 5: Verify the build. Let me install deps and try building:

⏺ Bash(npm install 2>&1 | tail -20)
  ⎿  added 11 packages, and audited 381 packages in 2s

     144 packages are looking for funding
     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good. Now let's try building the home app:

⏺ Bash(npx turbo run build --filter=@contentco-op/home 2>&1 | tail -40)
  ⎿  Attention:
     Turborepo now collects completely anonymous telemetry regarding usage.
     This information is used to shape the Turborepo roadmap and prioritize
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Need to add packageManager field to root package.json:

⏺ Bash(node -v 2>/dev/null; npm -v 2>/dev/null)
  ⎿  v25.6.1
     11.9.0

⏺ Update(package.json)
  ⎿  Added 1 line
      2    "name": "contentco-op-monorepo",
      3    "version": "0.2.0",
      4    "private": true,

      6    "workspaces": [
      7      "apps/*",
      8      "packages/*",

⏺ Bash(npx turbo run build --filter=@contentco-op/home 2>&1 | tail -50)
  ⎿  @contentco-op/brand:build: brand tokens: source only
     @contentco-op/types:build: types: source only
